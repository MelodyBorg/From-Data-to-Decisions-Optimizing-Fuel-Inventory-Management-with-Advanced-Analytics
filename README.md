# From-Data-to-Decisions-Optimizing-Fuel-Inventory-Management-with-Advanced-Analytics
Data analytics project optimizing fuel inventory across eight gas stations. Integrated multi-source data with Python to uncover inefficiencies, design refill simulations, and develop performance metrics. Resulted in over $440K CAD savings, improved efficiency, and standardized data-driven decision-making.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on improving fuel inventory management across a network of eight gas stations by transforming fragmented operational data into actionable insights. Using Python, pandas, and data visualization, we analyzed fuel levels, purchase behavior, and refill patterns to enhance cost efficiency, inventory reliability, and decision-making.

# Objectives
	•	Integrate multiple datasets (fuel levels, invoices, tanks, and locations) into a unified analytical framework.
	•	Detect inefficiencies in purchasing and replenishment patterns.
	•	Develop performance metrics to evaluate efficiency and operational risk.
	•	Simulate optimized refill strategies to minimize costs and stockouts.

# Key Insights
	•	Stations were often purchasing just below discount thresholds, missing over $33,000 CAD in potential savings.
	•	Refill frequencies varied widely—some refueled daily, others delayed for 30+ days—raising cost and stockout risks.
	•	Two custom metrics were developed:
	•	Turnover Rate (%): Efficiency of tank utilization.
	•	Low Safety Stock Frequency (%): Risk of operating below safe fuel levels.

# Results
	•	Implemented a refill simulation model triggering refills at safety thresholds while combining orders by fuel type.
	•	Low-stock incidents eliminated and refills aligned with real consumption patterns.
	•	Achieved over $440,000 CAD in potential cost savings at top-performing stations.

# Tools and Technologies
	•	Programming: Python
	•	Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
	•	Data Processing: Cleaning, merging, and feature engineering
	•	Visualization: Performance dashboards and simulation plots

# Impact

This project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can optimize traditional operations. By linking cost structures, purchasing habits, and capacity data, we built a scalable model for inventory optimization and strategic planning.
